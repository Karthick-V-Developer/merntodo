This code defines a simple Todo application using React with functional components and hooks. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

### Key Features:
1. State Management:
   - title, description: Used to store the current input for adding a new Todo item.
   - todos: An array that holds the list of all Todo items fetched from the server.
   - error, message: Strings used to display error or success messages to the user.
   - editId, editTitle, editDescription: Used to manage the editing of existing Todo items.

2. API Interaction:
   - apiUrl: A string storing the base URL for API requests.
   - handlesubmit: A function that handles the submission of new Todo items by making a POST request to the server. It updates the todos array and resets the input fields if the request is successful.
   - getItems: Fetches all Todo items from the server using a GET request and updates the todos state.
   - handleEdit: Prepares the component for editing by setting the appropriate state variables (editId, editTitle, editDescription) when the edit button is clicked.
   - handleUpdate: Sends a PUT request to update the Todo item on the server. It updates the corresponding item in the todos array locally and resets the editing state.
   - handleDelete: Sends a DELETE request to remove a Todo item from the server and updates the todos array locally.

3. Rendering:
   - The component initially fetches and displays all Todo items from the server when it mounts, using the useEffect hook.
